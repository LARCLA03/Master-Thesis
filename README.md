# Master-Thesis

The Master Thesis Repository of this GitHub is dedicated to a sample of code that was used during my Master Thesis. 

The analysis is here focused on Bitcoin Time series and several exogeneous factors - contained in the file "BNB_dtt_daily.csv". The methodology can be replicated with any type of assets. 

This code provides : 

- Representation of the returns of the asset analyzed
- Modelling of the returns using MARX model
- Forecasting using MARX model.
